        <h2>About</h2>
		<p>ToySmart Toys Mart was founded in 1994 by two childhood friends, Ronnen and Anton, soon after graduation from The University of Janmaica. Ben, a classmate of Anton's from The University of Jamaica's Richard School of business, joined the Company subsequently in 1994.</p>
		<p>The nascent entrepreneurs' first product was the Moon Stars, a nylon stocking-covered head of sawdust topped with grass seeds which grew to emulate hair, funded with their own $10,000 investment. With Anton selling the item on the street and to specialty retailers, the operation quickly expanded to a small facility in downtown Toronto. This initial success served as the springboard for the ToySmart Toys Mart entry into the toy business.</p>
